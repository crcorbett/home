# Deployment Guide

This guide walks through deploying your monorepo apps to production.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with your code
- Vercel account (free tier works)
- Apps building successfully locally

## Step 1: Verify Local Build

Before deploying, ensure everything builds:

```bash
# Type check all packages
bun run check-types

# Lint all code
bun run check

# Build everything
bun run build
```

Fix any errors before proceeding.

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: ready for deployment"
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Import to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Choose the app to deploy

## Step 4: Configure Build Settings

For each app, configure:

### Root Directory

Set to the app folder:

- Web: `apps/web`
- Admin: `apps/admin`
- Docs: `apps/docs`

### Build Command

```bash
cd ../.. && bun run build --filter=<app-name>
```

Replace `<app-name>` with `web`, `admin`, or `docs`.

### Install Command

```bash
cd ../.. && bun install
```

### Output Directory

```
.output
```

## Step 5: Environment Variables

Add any required environment variables:

1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each variable
3. Set scope (Production, Preview, Development)

Common variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: `production`
- API keys for external services
- Feature flags

## Step 6: Deploy

Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete.

## Step 7: Configure Domain

1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS as instructed

### Recommended Setup

```
www.example.com     → web app
admin.example.com   → admin app
docs.example.com    → docs app
```

## Step 8: Enable Preview Deployments

Preview deployments are enabled by default. Each PR gets a unique URL.

## Step 9: Set Up CI Integration

The repository already includes CI workflows. To enable Turborepo remote caching:

1. Go to [vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)
2. Create a new token
3. Add to GitHub Secrets as `TURBO_TOKEN`
4. Add `TURBO_TEAM` as a variable (your Vercel team slug)

## Deploying Multiple Apps

Repeat steps 3-6 for each app:

1. Create a new Vercel project for each app
2. Point each to the same repository
3. Set different root directories

## Monitoring

### Build Logs

View in Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to Deployments
2. Click a deployment
3. View build logs

### Runtime Logs

For SSR/API issues:

1. Go to Project → Functions
2. View function logs

### Analytics

Enable Vercel Analytics:

1. Go to Project → Analytics
2. Enable Web Analytics
3. Add tracking to your app

## Rollback

If a deployment has issues:

1. Go to Deployments
2. Find the last working deployment
3. Click "..." → "Promote to Production"

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

1. Check build logs for errors
2. Run `bun run build` locally
3. Verify all dependencies are installed

### Environment Variables Missing

1. Check variable names match exactly
2. Verify scope includes Production
3. Redeploy after adding variables

### SSR Not Working

1. Check for browser-only code in server paths
2. Verify Nitro configuration
3. Check function logs

### Slow Builds

1. Enable Turborepo remote caching
2. Check if cache is being hit
3. Review build output for issues
