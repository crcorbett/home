# CI/CD

This monorepo uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment with automated versioning via Changesets.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

<Cards>
  <Card title="CI Workflow" href="/docs/ci-cd/github-actions">
    Type checking, linting, and building on every push and PR
  </Card>
  <Card title="Release Workflow" href="/docs/ci-cd/changesets">
    Automated versioning and changelog generation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deployment" href="/docs/ci-cd/deployment">
    Deploying apps to Vercel
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Pipeline Flow

```
Push to main
    │
    ├── CI Workflow
    │   ├── Type check
    │   ├── Lint
    │   └── Build
    │
    └── Release Workflow
        ├── Create version PR (if changesets exist)
        └── Tag releases (when version PR merges)
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run CI checks locally
bun run check-types
bun run check
bun run build

# Create a changeset for your changes
bun run changeset

# Version packages (usually done by CI)
bun run changeset:version

# Publish packages (if public)
bun run changeset:publish
```

## Key Features

### Automated Type Checking

Every push and PR runs TypeScript type checking across all packages:

```yaml
- name: Type check
  run: bun run check-types
```

### Rust-Based Linting

Fast linting with Ultracite (oxlint + oxfmt):

```yaml
- name: Lint
  run: bun run check
```

### Parallel Builds

Turborepo builds all packages in parallel with caching:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: bun run build
```

### Changesets Versioning

Automated version management:

1. Create changesets during development
2. CI creates a version PR
3. Merging the PR publishes and tags releases

### AI Code Review

Optional AI-powered code review on pull requests:

```yaml
- name: AI Code Review
  uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@beta
```
